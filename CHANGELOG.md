* tweaked documentation

## 0.5.0

## 0.4.8
* fixed PR #35: added exchange_withdrawal transaction type to Coinbase plugin
* various documentation improvements
* updated RP2 dependency to 1.0.0

## 0.4.7
* fixed issue #34: sometimes Coinbase returns bad fiat data for crypto conversions (fiat amount of sale < fiat amount of buy). DaLI used to raise an exception: now it issues a warning and sets the fiat fee to 0
* Coinbase plugin: _process_transfer() refactoring

## 0.4.6
* fixed PRs #31 and #36: various improvements to the logic that reads prices from Web

## 0.4.5
* Coinbase Pro: fixed a bug which caused the total fiat value (including fee) to be incorrect for certain crypto conversions
* added developer FAQ

## 0.4.4
* fixed a regression introduced recently: in certain cases, some fees related to conversions would no longer be generated (thus causing small deductions to be ignored)
* added support for USDC: previously it was conflated into fiat and didn't generate a tab, now it does
* Coinbase plugin: added support for fiat_withdrawal and fiat_deposit transactions. They are now tracked internally and no longer cause an unsupported transaction warning
* Coinbase Pro plugin: added support for "conversion" native transactions (these seem to occur when CBPro converts from/to a stable coin)
* minor changes to documentation

## 0.4.3
* rewrote Coinbase coin swap logic: it now handles correctly swaps from stable coins with a fee (previously it would ignore the fee)
* various documentation fixes and some refactoring

## 0.4.2
* fixed issue #21: fee-typed out-transactions in the manual plugin would cause an exception
* reviewed all documentation

## 0.4.1
* minor documentation fixes

## 0.4.0
* fixed issue #20: Coinbase plugin now supports the staking_reward transaction type
* fix for Coinbase reporting fiat with low precision (only 2 decimal digits): if the value is less than 1c Coinbase rounds it to zero, which caused various computation problems (spot_price, etc.). As a workaround, when this condition is detected the plugin sets affected fields to UNKNOWN or None (depending on their nature), so that they can be filled later by the transaction resolver and RP2

## 0.3.28
* added threading support to Coinbase Pro
* thread count can now be specified in the plugin configuration section of the .ini file
* additional fix in missing fiat_fee issue in crypto swaps on Coinbase (issue #15)
* updated documentation

## 0.3.27
* fix for missing fiat_fee issue in crypto swaps on Coinbase (issue #15)

## 0.3.26
* -s CLI option to read missing spot prices from Web: rewrote implementation from Yahoo Finance (daily granularity) to Coinbase Pro (minute granularity)
* moved cache logic to its own module, so it can be used in multiple places: plugins, transaction_resolver, etc.
* fixed issue #19: the user needs to pass -s to read highly granular price data from Coinbase Pro, when it's missing (or computed as 0)

## 0.3.25
* merged PR #18: Coinbase plugin wasn't handling crypto conversions correctly and generated negative amounts.

## 0.3.23
* merged PR #14: in Coinbase Pro plugin crypto fee is now modeled correctly both for buy and sell-side fills
* fixed issue #16: added support for inflation_reward transaction in Coinbase plugin
* added load caching to speed up development (PR #12)
* added parallelism to Coinbase plugin (PR #12)

## 0.3.22
* fixed issue #16: added support for Coinbase inflation reward transaction
* added error log for unknown transaction type in all plugins, so they are easy to identify and report
* added FAQ on supported exchanges/wallets
* added support for more transaction types in BlockFi plugin (PR #11)

## 0.3.21
* fixed bug reported in issue https://github.com/eprbell/dali-rp2/issues/10
* fixed from/to_currency detection in Coinbase Pro plugin (PR #9)
* added initial version of developer FAQ document: https://github.com/eprbell/dali-rp2/blob/main/docs/developer_faq.md
* minor fixes to documentation

## 0.3.20
* fixed a bug in transaction resolver: IN -> IN transaction hint was assigning wrong value to fiat_fee
* fixed a bug in Coinbase plugin: receiving a crypto gift from another Coinbase user generated a transaction with wrong fiat_in_with_fee value
* reworked some of the code to use latest RP2 features: specifically fee-only transactions and crypto_fee in in-transactions. E.g.: Coinbase Pro coin swap code, transaction resolver INTRA -> OUT transaction hint application, etc.
* DaLI output file (the RP2 input file) now has in-transaction crypto_fee. Also updated unit test golden file
* refactored all transaction constructor calls to use keyword arg calling style
* updated setup.cfg dependencies to latest RP2

## 0.3.19
* Trezor plugin: AM/PM was not parsed correctly in timestamp. Fixed.
* Minor fixes

## 0.3.18
* fixed a limitation in timestamp processing in Trezor and Trezor Old plugins. The timezone that was passed to the plugin constructor could only be an ISO 8601 format offset: something like "America/Los Angeles" would not be accepted. This caused problems with daylight saving timestamps in Trezor CSV files: daylight savings time would just be ignored, thus causing Trezor summer timestamps to be 1 hour off
* updated input, input/golden, config and docs/configuration_file.md to reflect the above fix
* added pytz stubs

## v0.3.17
* added new FAQ on adding support for new wallets and exchanges
* minor fixes

## v0.3.16
* Trezor plugin: dusting attack was incorrectly interpreted as cost-only transaction. Now it issues a warning to the user
* minor fixes to documentation

## v0.3.15
* minor edits to documentation and metafiles

## v0.3.12
* fixed a few broken links in README.md (when used from Pypi only)
* fixed CLI --help description
* minor improvements to documentation

## v0.3.7
* major improvements to documentation
* added notes in generated file to describe crypto conversion transactions in Coinbase Pro
* small performance improvement: signature reflexive call is now called only once per class, instead of once per instance

## v0.3.6
* template.ods was missing from the final package. Fixed in setup.cfg
* various fixes to documentation

## v0.3.4
* First version tracked in change log and uploaded to Github
